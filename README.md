# Attribute-Conditioned-GAN
A GAN-based framework for attribute-conditioned cartoon face generation using metadata and reinforcement learning. The model combines a DCGAN, an attribute classifier, and an RL agent to control latent codes, enabling diverse and semantically guided image synthesis under limited computational resources.
